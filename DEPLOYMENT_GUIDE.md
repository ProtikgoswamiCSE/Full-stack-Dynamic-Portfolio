# Deployment Guide for Full-stack Dynamic Portfolio

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Permission Issues
- **Problem**: Laravel couldn't write to storage/logs/laravel.log and database.sqlite
- **Solution**: Updated Dockerfile to set proper permissions for nginx user
- **Changes**:
  - Set storage and bootstrap/cache directories to 775 permissions
  - Set database.sqlite to 664 permissions
  - Ensured nginx user owns all necessary files

### 2. Database Write Issues
- **Problem**: SQLite database was read-only
- **Solution**: Added proper ownership and permissions for database file
- **Changes**:
  - Database directory owned by nginx user
  - Database file has 664 permissions (read/write for owner and group)

### 3. Log File Issues
- **Problem**: Laravel couldn't create or write to log files
- **Solution**: Ensure log file exists and has proper permissions
- **Changes**:
  - Create laravel.log file if it doesn't exist
  - Set proper ownership and permissions

## Deployment Steps

### For Render.com Deployment:

1. **Push your changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix permission issues for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Your service should automatically redeploy with the new Dockerfile
   - Monitor the build logs for any issues

### For Local Testing:

1. **Test with Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Run the test script
   test-deployment.bat
   
   # Or manually:
   docker build -t portfolio-test .
   docker run -d --name portfolio-test -p 8080:80 portfolio-test
   ```

2. **Check the application**:
   - Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   - Check if the home page loads correctly
   - Verify that CSS and other assets are loading

## Key Configuration Changes

### Dockerfile Updates:
- Added proper permission settings for storage directories
- Ensured database file is writable
- Added log file creation and permission setting
- Updated startup script to handle permissions at runtime

### render.yaml Updates:
- Added additional environment variables for better configuration
- Set proper logging and caching settings

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get permission errors:

1. **Check container logs**:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container-name>
   ```

2. **Verify file permissions inside container**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-name> ls -la /var/www/html/storage/
   docker exec -it <container-name> ls -la /var/www/html/database/
   ```

3. **Check if nginx user can write**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-name> whoami
   docker exec -it <container-name> touch /var/www/html/storage/test.txt
   ```

### Common Issues:

1. **Database locked**: Usually means another process is using the database
2. **Permission denied**: Check file ownership and permissions
3. **Directory not found**: Ensure all required directories are created

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Render environment:
- `APP_NAME`: Full-stack Dynamic Portfolio
- `APP_ENV`: production
- `APP_DEBUG`: false
- `DB_CONNECTION`: sqlite
- `DB_DATABASE`: /var/www/html/database/database.sqlite
- `LOG_CHANNEL`: stack
- `LOG_LEVEL`: error

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code to Render
2. Test the application thoroughly
3. Check all pages and functionality
4. Verify that CSS and assets are loading correctly
5. Test the admin panel if applicable

The permission issues should now be resolved, and your Laravel application should work properly on Render.
