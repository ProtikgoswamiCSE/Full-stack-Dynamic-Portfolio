# Admin Panel Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Admin Dashboard
- **Problem**: The `/admin` route was pointing to `editHome` instead of a proper dashboard
- **Solution**: Created a new `dashboard.blade.php` view with a modern, responsive admin interface
- **Added**: Dashboard method in `AdminController` with statistics and quick action cards

### 2. Missing Social Media Links Table
- **Problem**: The `social_media_links` table was referenced in models but didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created migration `2025_08_31_150717_create_social_media_links_table.php`
- **Structure**: Includes platform, name, icon_class, url, order, and is_active fields

### 3. Missing Initial Content
- **Problem**: Admin panel had no default content to work with
- **Solution**: Created `AdminContentSeeder` with sample data for all sections
- **Content**: Sample home content, social links, skills, footer, and achievements

### 4. Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Admin views had inconsistent navigation and missing dashboard links
- **Solution**: Updated navigation in all admin views to include dashboard link
- **Added**: Consistent sidebar navigation across all admin pages
